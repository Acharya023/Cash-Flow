📘 PROJECT TITLE: Cash Flow Forecasting & Company Valuation Dashboard (DCF-Based)

🧭 OVERVIEW:
This project simulates the end-to-end financial analysis process of a company using real-world modeling methods. Built using Power BI, Excel, and Python, the system forecasts future cash flows, estimates business valuation through a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, and dynamically tests financial health using What-If Scenario Analysis.

The project is designed to mirror the workflow of financial analysts in FP&A, investment analysis, and corporate finance — starting from raw transaction-level data and ending in strategic insights such as share price estimation and cash runway risk monitoring.


⚙️ TOOLS USED:
- **Python** – Forecasting with `statsmodels` (Exponential Smoothing)
- **Excel** – Statement modeling, assumptions, and DCF math
- **Power BI** – Visual dashboard, scenario modeling, KPI tracking
- **DAX** – Calculated measures (Cash Runway, Net Cash, Share Price)

---

🎯 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS ENABLED:
- Real-time burn rate and cash runway alerts
- Share price sensitivity to business performance
- Terminal value visualization for long-term value
- Analyst-style valuation bridge (Enterprise → Equity → Share)

📤 OUTPUTS & DELIVERABLES:
- 6-month forecast (`forecast.xlsx`) for short-term charts
- 5-year FCFs (`fcf_forecast.xlsx`) for DCF valuation
- Power BI dashboard with 5 interactive pages
- Documented Excel files (`dcf_model.xlsx`, `financial_statements.xlsx`) with clear inputs and assumptions
